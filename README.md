FearRoom 
Overview
FearRoom is a Unity project focused on creating an unsettling and immersive experience through the effective use of lighting and sound. The project aims to evoke fear and suspense in the player, making it suitable for horror game development or atmospheric experiences.

Features
1. Flashing Lights
The FearRoom project employs a custom script for light sources, compatible with various light types such as point lights, spotlights, and directional lights. The script introduces flashing lights to the scene, creating an uncomfortable ambience. This effect is versatile and can be easily adapted to different light sources, enhancing the overall unsettling atmosphere. Additionally, the same effect can be achieved through animations, providing flexibility in implementation.

Ambient Background Sound: Sets a wary and eerie tone throughout the gameplay.
